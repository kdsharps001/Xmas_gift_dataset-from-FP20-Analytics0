### DATA CLEANING
The data provided by FP20 Analytics was a clean data with neither errors nor missing values.

### TYPE OF ANALYSIS
The type of analysis performed on the Christmas dataset using SQL queries within SQL Server Management Studio can be categorized as exploratory and descriptive analysis.

1. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, available columns, and general patterns present in the data.
   - Identifying relationships between different variables such as customer demographics, product categories, sales figures, and geographical distribution.
   - Investigating various dimensions within the dataset to uncover potential trends, outliers, or interesting patterns that could guide further analysis.

2. **Descriptive Analysis:**
   - Calculating summary statistics like counts, averages, maximum and minimum values, and totals for different attributes such as sales, profits, customer demographics, product types, and geographical aspects.
   - Categorizing and grouping data to gain insights into customer behaviors, popular products, preferred payment methods, and sales trends during the Christmas period.
   - Providing a detailed overview and description of the dataset's characteristics and distributions to comprehend key metrics and trends.

Through the SQL queries executed in SQL Server Management Studio, the analysis aimed to derive meaningful insights, understand patterns, and summarize the dataset's information without employing predictive modeling or hypothesis testing commonly associated with more advanced analytical methods like predictive analytics or inferential statistics. The focus was on understanding historical data patterns to draw actionable insights and make data-informed decisions.

### RESULTS
The analysis of the Xmas dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales transactions during the festive Christmas season, uncovering several crucial insights. Total sales reached $3,371,636, with a substantial profit margin of $2,579,472, reflecting the overall success during this period. The dataset portrays diverse purchase behaviors across three primary product types: children (7,566 purchases), adults (4,448 purchases), and teens (4,369 purchases), indicating varied preferences among different age ranges. Key countries such as Austria ($605,841.8), Poland ($601,634.7), and Italy ($376,893.1) emerged as top performers, suggesting potential areas for market expansion. Notably, Poland had the highest purchase count of 3,077, while the Netherlands recorded the lowest purchase count of 754 among the listed .countries

### RECOMMENDATIONS
To leverage the dataset insights, businesses should tailor marketing strategies to target specific customer segments and geographical regions. Optimizing payment methods to accommodate prevalent preferences such as cash (8,262 transactions) and credit/debit cards (3,061 transactions) can significantly enhance customer satisfaction. Focusing on high-selling products like Chess Sets and Hot Wheels Car Sets, which demonstrated both high sales volumes and considerable profit margins, can optimize inventory management and potentially increase overall profitability. Targeting high-budget Christmas shoppers and capitalizing on peak sales hours, particularly at 18:00 (1,440 purchases), could maximize sales opportunities.

### Limitations
The datasets provided was clean and easy to read. However, the link to the pctures of stores and the countries were not accessible online.
